# Advanced Calculator

A console app from scratch using C++ that has Basic operations, Advanced operations like sqrt and power, ASCII table, and a Digital system that allows converting from any base to another and making binary calculations.

## Features

The Advanced Calculator offers the following features:

1. Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Advanced Operations: Square root and power functions.
3. ASCII Table: Display and explore the ASCII characters and their corresponding values.
4. Digital System: Convert numbers between different bases (binary, decimal, hexadecimal, etc.) and perform binary calculations.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the Advanced Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the [source code](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Advanced-Calculator/blob/master/main.cpp) files.
```
https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Advanced-Calculator.git
```
2. Open a C++ compiler or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
3. Create a new project.
4. Add the downloaded source code files to your project.
5. Build and compile the project.

## Usage

Once the application is compiled and running, you can interact with the Advanced Calculator through the console. The application provides a menu-based interface, allowing you to select different options.

1. Basic Operations:
   - Select the basic operation you want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
   - Enter the operands when prompted.
   - The result will be displayed.

2. Advanced Operations:
   - Choose the advanced operation you wish to perform (square root or power).
   - Provide the required input values.
   - The calculated result will be displayed.

3. ASCII Table:
   - Select the ASCII Table option.
   - The table will be displayed, showing the characters and their corresponding values.

4. Digital System:
   - Choose the Digital System option.
   - Select the conversion type or binary calculation option.
   - Follow the instructions provided to enter the required input and perform the desired operation.
